##IP Notifier
Back when I was hosting a Minecraft server for some friends on a Windows machine, we would experience periodical public IP address changes. Sometimes this would happen when I was not home to find out and update the IP for those using the server. I created this small app that would check every ten minutes for a IP address change. If there was one detected, it would email me. It is currently configured to use Outlook's service, but could easily be changed for a different email service.
